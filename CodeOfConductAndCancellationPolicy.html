<p>The general welfare of any group depends upon the conduct of each individual member. This Code of Conduct ensures the success of our Conclave and provides the maximum benefit to every participant. The Conclave leadership is responsible for the supervision of the event in respect to maintaining discipline and security, and every participant must agree to the following Code of Conduct:
<br>
  <br>Observe the Scout Oath or Promise, the Scout Law and the Order of the Arrow Obligation. Follow the policies of the Boy Scouts of America including Youth Protection and Social Media. Adhere to directions given by base personnel or conclave leadership.
  <br>Dress, according to the schedule, in either field uniform (Class A) or activity uniform (Class B) through the entire event. Wear the provided Conclave credential (name badge) when out of assigned housing area.
  <br>The use of tobacco in any form, alcoholic beverages, illicit drugs, weapons of any kind including laser pointers, firearms, fireworks, or gambling is strictly prohibited.
  <br>Participants and staff will be actively engaged in the Conclave program.
  <br>Participants will be personally liable for any breakage, damage or loss of property.
  <br>Participants must sleep in their designated housing area. Everyone must observe curfew and lights-out rules, and keep their sleeping area clean and tidy.
  <br>Participants are not authorized to sell items at the event. The official trading posts are the only source for purchasing items at the event aside from lodge operated trading posts in assigned areas.
  <br>Every participant must comply with all laws, as well as any special rules or regulations of the faciility, such as staying away from restricted and controlled areas.
  <br>Once a car is parked for the event, it must remain in the designated parking lot until departure unless a driving pass has been issued by the Section Adviser or Conclave Service Lodge Adviser.
<p>The lodge adviser or contingent leader will approve the corrective measures for a violation of these rules before being implemented. Corrective measures will be at the discretion of the Conclave leadership, which may include dismissal from Conclave.</p>
<p>Payments for registration and trading post fees are refundable less a 15% processing fee up until May 1. On or after May 1, there are no refunds. If a registrant does not attend Conclave, his or her packet (and trading post order, if applicable) will be provided to his or her lodge leadership for distribution.</p>
<p>Unpaid registrants have until May 1 to request a cancellation of their registration. If a cancellation request is not received, the registrant’s council may be billed for his or her outstanding fee(s).</p>
