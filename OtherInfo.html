  <p>Agent,<br>
  There are several other events that have been declassified for your viewing.<br>
  Firstly, there will be a Covert Spy Challenge.<br>
  This will require you to complete challenges with a fellow spy.<br>
  Your scouting skills, mental capability, and physical ability will be put to the test.<br>
  Work through the missions, and be the first to complete all the challenges to receive the title of Top Spy.<br><br>
  Secondly, there will be an event deemed 'Assassin'<br>
  You will be required to be able to recognize someone in a crowd.<br>
  Be careful as you turn every corner and always check your back.<br>
  Are you brave enough to eliminate your targets before someone takes you out?<br>
  This game will put spy against spy as the whole weekend is fair game, minus designated safe areas.<br>
  Last one standing will be crowned the Top Assassin.<br><br>
  The last declassified event is entitled 'Gladiator Joust'<br>
  Can you tough it out and be the last one standing?<br>
  Your skills will be tested as you compete one on one.<br>
  Your strength and balance will be put to the test, are you ready?<br></p><br>
  <p>In addition to those events, this year's Communication Team will be like none before it!<br>
  Our operatives will be undercover all over Conclave gathering intel for the Conclave Newsletter.<br>
